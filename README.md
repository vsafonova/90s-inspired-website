# 90s-inspired-website
This is my learning project, which was inspired by 90-s (https://vsafonova.github.io/90s-inspired-website/)

During "The fundamentals" part of my studying at Hyper Island I needed to demonstrate some skills: Build a responsive web page using appropriate HTML tags and attributes to structure your content as well as appropriate CSS selectors and properties to introduce style and layout.
